# Techsoc Gatsby Extensions

A plugin for the Wordpress Backend that defines certain post types (events, projects), and gives them a graphQL endpoint. This also exposes certain parts of themes that currently cannot be done natively with WPGraphQL (i.e the Site Logo)

## Installation
1. Download the source code as a ZIP file
2. Log in to the wordpress backend as usual
3. Goto Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
4. Select and upload the zip file just downloaded from this repository.
